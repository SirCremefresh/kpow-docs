# OpenShift

## Basics

{% hint style="success" %}
kPow is compatible with **Red Hat AMQ Streams**
{% endhint %}

kPow is available as an Operator on the Red Hat Marketplace and OperatorHub.io.

Installed in one click and requiring little configuration, kPow will manage and monitor your Kafka resources \(including Clusters, Schema Registries, and Connect Installations\) security and safely with all data stored in local topics within your cluster.

## Prerequisites

kPow has two prerequisites:

#### License

kPow requires a license to operate, [get a 30-day free trial license in minutes](https://kpow.io/try).

If you purchase kPow on the Red Hat Marketplace a license will automatically be provisioned for you.

#### Kafka Cluster

kPow requires at least one Kafka Cluster bootstrap URL in order to start correctly
