# Our Team

kPow is [**built by the team at Operatr.IO**](https://operatr.io).

We are a company of engineers who started working with Kafka in 2012 and have decades of experience delivering Enterprise systems. 

Our tools come from a **practical application of Kafka to real-world requirements and problems**.

kPow is our flagship product and was originally called simply Operatr \(yes, we know, _terrible name_\). 

Today we work on [**kPow**](https://kpow.io), [**kJQ**](https://operatr.io/kjq/), and [**kSynth**](https://operatr.io/ksynth) - tools with different roles in the world of streaming compute.

See Derek Troy-West's talk at the 2019 Clojure/conj to understand more about our excitement for Kafka.
