# Our Team

kPow is [**built by the team at Operatr.IO**](https://operatr.io).

We are a company of engineers who started working with Kafka in 2012 and have decades of experience delivering Enterprise systems.&#x20;

Our tools come from a **practical application of Kafka to real-world requirements and problems**.

kPow is our flagship product and was originally called simply Operatr (yes, we know, _terrible name_).&#x20;

See our talk at the 2019 Clojure/Conj to understand more about our excitement for Kafka.
