# Our Team

kPow is built by the team at [Operatr.IO.](https://operatr.io)

We are a company of engineers who started working with Kafka in 2012 and have decades of experience delivering Enterprise systems. Our tools come from a practical application of Kafka to real-world requirements and problems.

kPow is our flagship product and was originally called simply Operatr \(yes, we understand - not a great name given Kubernetes Operators\). Today we work on kPow, kJQ, and kSynth - all tools that play different roles in the modern ecosystem of streaming compute.

To understand more of our team and what excites us about Apache Kafka, see Derek Troy-West's talk at the 2019 Clojure/conj:
